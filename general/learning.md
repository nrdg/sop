# Learning

In order to do our work well, we need to learn a lot of things.

## Data science for neuroimaging

A good starting point is [Ariel's book](https://neuroimaging-data-science.org/root.html)

There are also many videos from Neurohackademy with tutorials and lectures. Links can be found through the "courses" tab on the [NeuroHackademy website](https://neurohackademy.org/)

## Diffusion MRI

This OHBM blog post is a great starting point for learning about diffusion: https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/ohbm-ondemand-how-to-diffusion-mri

A variety of more specific topics are available in recordings from the DIPY YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@DiffusionImaginginPython
