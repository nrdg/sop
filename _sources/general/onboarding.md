# Onboarding

## Welcome

Welcome on board! This document provides information about the first few steps that you should take to become a member of the group. It includes pointers to many other parts of the SOP, that will provide you more detailed information.

## Resources and access:

1. Get on Slack

We use Slack for immediate communications between members of the team. Ask Ariel to add you to the group slack.

2. Get on GitHub

We use git and GitHub to keep track of our projects. Create a GitHub user-name [here](http://github.com/join) and ask Ariel to add you to the teams and projects relevant to your work.


3. Get on AWS

We use Amazon Web Services for some projects. If you need credentials to AWS to do your work, as Ariel to give you the access.


```{note}
While we try to vigorously apply the [principal of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), so that you have only the access you really need to do your work, please take care of any AWS credentials you might receive. Please do not post them anywhere public (don't commit them to a git repo!) and report any breach that happens, as soon as you discover it (if you commited credentials, let someone know as soon as possible!)
```

4. Key-card access to CHN space. Ask Ariel to email the building manager with your UW student/employee number.


## Designing a individual development program

An individual development program (or IDP) is a methodology used to set goals
for mentorship interactions. The IDP is a "living document" that records both
goals (long-term and short-term) and concrete plans to achieve these goals. As
the name implies, the goal of the IDP is specifically the development of the
individual and focuses on the things that the person wants to learn and achieve.
It is developed in collaboration with a supervisor and balances a person's
interests and individual goals with their obligations (e.g., courses that are
required, teaching that needs to get done, other kinds of goals), though these
may sometimes be correlated. A good plan would support both a set of consistent
long-term goals, as well as shifting targets for short-term and long-term.
Keeping track of changes in the IDP provides a good way to track how a person's
interests and goals are changing over time, providing useful material for
individual reflection. There are a variety of templates that can be used.

As a general rule, we should try to revisit the IDP twice a year, using a
one-on-one meeting with Ariel to discuss these changes. These meeting should
take place at reasonable points in time: at the beginning of end of large cycles
of work (e.g., end of a project, end of an academic year, or its beginning). It
is jointly the responsible of Ariel and the person in question to make sure that
these updates happen.

To download a Word template file click [here](https://github.com/nrdg/sop/raw/master/assets/IDP_template.docx). This
template provides a good starting point for writing an IDP, with some links out
to additional resources.

If you are a student and you need further career guidance, it might also be a good idea to seek counseling on this topic from the [UW Counseling Center](https://www.washington.edu/counseling/services/career-exploration/).

## Training in responsible conduct of research

There are many ways to get training on responsible conduct of research at UW. At the very least, everyone in the group is required to undergo CITI training as part of their onboarding process. Instructions are available on [this webpage](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/training/required-training/web-based-citi-training/). In addition, there are courses that you can take to fulfill the requirements of particular training programs (e.g., some fellowships require extensive training on the topic). Some resources on this topic are available on [this page](https://www.washington.edu/research/compliance/responsible-conduct-of-research-rcrtraining/). In addition, given the work that we do, it is a good idea to take a course specifically about data science ethics. There is a list on [this page](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-courses-at-the-university-of-washington/).

## Mentoring philosophy

The goal of scientific mentorship is for trainees to develop their ability to
conduct independent research. The starting point varies between individual
trainees, and mentorship must meet every mentee where they are. Growing in
indepenence and ability entails encouraging a growth mindset, the outlook that
argues that every individual can change their skills and abilities with
learning and experience. This entails providing challenging research objectives
to achieve and providing the means and guidance to achieve these objectives. At
the same time, mentorship of individual trainees needs to be designed to help
them meet their own individual goals, while also pursuing the goals of our
overall research program. A research program as broad and ambitious as the one
that we pursue at the NRDG can accommodate individuals with many different
goals, and get them closer to discovering and achieving these disparate goals.
For example, trainees may be interested to explore different options for the
career path that they would pursue, and the mentorship and training that will
be provided should be tailored to prepare them for the career path of their
choice.
