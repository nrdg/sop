# Onboarding

## Welcome

Welcome on board! This document provides information about the first few steps that you should take to become a member of the group. It includes pointers to many other parts of the SOP, that will provide you more detailed information.

## Resources and access:

1. Get on Slack

We use Slack for immediate communications between members of the team. Ask Ariel to add you to the group slack.

2. Get on GitHub

We use git and GitHub to keep track of our projects. Create a GitHub user-name [here](http://github.com/join) and ask Ariel to add you to the teams and projects relevant to your work.

## Training in responsible conduct of research

There are many ways to get training on responsible conduct of research at UW. At the very least, everyone in the group is required to undergo CITI training as part of their onboarding process. Instructions are available on [this webpage](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/training/required-training/web-based-citi-training/). In addition, there are courses that you can take to fulfill the requirements of particular training programs (e.g., some fellowships require extensive training on the topic). Some resources on this topic are available on [this page](https://www.washington.edu/research/compliance/responsible-conduct-of-research-rcrtraining/). In addition, given the work that we do, it is a good idea to take a course specifically about data science ethics. There is a list on [this page](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-courses-at-the-university-of-washington/).
