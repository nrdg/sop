# General information

This section includes general information about the NRDG.

## Location

Our offices are located on the 5th floor of Kincaid Hall, within the Center for
Human Neuroscience. You can find Ariel's office in room 527b, and there is a
room with four desks adjacent to that (527) that folks can use. There are other
rooms with desks throughout the CHN space, and folks can choose to have their
desk in one of these other spaces, based on availability.

## Working hours

I it is well understood that different people have different needs and get their
work done at different times and under different conditions, based on their own
constraints. Much of our work can be done in asynchronous manner, allowing
different people to choose the times of day/week during which they will get
their work done.

That said, overall objectives and specific goals and deadlines should be
revisited on a regular basis and should be adjusted based on *mutual agreement*.
This should help folks make progress towards their goals, and also prevent
people from spinning their wheels.

### Meetings

Everyone is expected to attend weekly group meetings and weekly journal clubs /
code reviews (and to lead these on a regular basis). In addition, a weekly
one-on-one meeting with Ariel is required to discuss progress on projects and
work together. Currently, these meetings take place through zoom.
