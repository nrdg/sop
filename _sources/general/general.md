# General information

This section includes general information about the NRDG.

## Working hours

I it is well understood that different people have different needs and get their
work done at different times/conditions, based on their own constraints.
Much of our work can be done in asynchronous manner, allowing different people to
choose the times of day/week during which they will get their work done.

That said, overall objectives and specific goals and deadlines should be
revisited on a regular basis and should be adjusted based on *mutual agreement*.
This should help folks make progress towards their goals, and also prevent
people from spinning their wheels.

### Meetings

Everyone is expected to attend weekly group meetings and weekly journal clubs /
code reviews (and to lead these on a regular basis). In addition, a weekly
one-on-one meeting with Ariel is required to discuss progress on projects and
work together.
