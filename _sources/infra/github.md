# GitHub

The group's GitHub organization can be found at [https://github.com/nrdg](https://github.com/nrdg).

We also maintain several community-based repositories at [https://github.com/tractometry](https://github.com/tractometry).

Our general development workflow follows very closely [the approach used by
nibabel and many other projects](https://nipy.org/nibabel/gitwash/index.html):
Developers create a _fork_ of the repository, and contribute code through pull
requests from feature branches on their fork of the repository. Though it
requires some initial learning, this workflow provides the best experience
long-term for developers and maintainers of a software repository, so it's
well-worth learning. This also means that you do not need membership in the
GitHub organizations mentioned above to start working on our code-bases. That
said, if you do need to join these organizations and start merging code in
repositories managed through these organizations, please let Ariel know and he
will add your GitHub user name to the ACLs.
